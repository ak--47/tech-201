# SE Capstone 2026

Over the past year and half, we have grown as a team, learning deeply about the technologies that power modern data engineering and analytics.

What started with some [things worth knowing](https://www.notion.so/mxpnl/Tech-101-Things-worth-Knowing-110e0ba925628069a141ff7c32b2d670?source=copy_link) evolved into a comprehensive [101 curriculum](https://www.notion.so/mxpnl/18fe0ba92562809e9ff2fee3d7083d92?v=18fe0ba925628082af94000c38874e2a&source=copy_link) which was so successful that we followed it up with [Tech 201](https://www.notion.so/mxpnl/Tech-201-229e0ba925628035acb4c7b07285c810?source=copy_link) to dive deeper into advanced topics such as [data structures](https://github.com/ak--47/tech-201/blob/main/data-structures.js), [transactional and analytical SQL](https://github.com/ak--47/database-learnin), and [modern cloud data warehouses](https://github.com/ak--47/tech-201/blob/main/data-warehouse.sql).

Pat yourself on the back for making it this far! You've demonstrated commitment, curiosity, and a passion for learning that will serve you well in your future endeavors.

You have now arrived at the capstone project, where you will apply all that you've learned in a practical, hands-on way. This is your opportunity to showcase your skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities that corresponds to your IC level.

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, you will work on a real-world data engineering problem from start to finish. You will be responsible for designing and **implementing a data pipeline** that takes **files in google cloud storage** and brings them into Mixpanel as **well-formed events, properties, and users**.

You should then make a ~10min final presentation (slides + code + demo) of your project, highlighting the architecture, technologies used, and any challenges you faced along the way.

Your final presentation should include details on:

- The _tools and technologies_ you used
- The _architecture_ of your data pipeline
- Any _modeling/cleaning challenges_ you faced and how you overcame them
- Key _learnings and takeaways_ from the project

We are extremely open to the tools and technologies you choose to use for this project. Feel free to leverage any of the technologies we've covered in our curriculum, or explore new ones that you find interesting. 

Should you need access to any Google Cloud or Mixpanel resources, reach out to AK and he'll be happy to assist you.

(hint: loading your dataset into bigQuery is a great starting point! y'all already have access)


## Timing + Deliverables

You need to complete 3 things:
1. A working data pipeline that meets the requirements of your IC level dataset
2. A slide deck summarizing your project
3. A ~10min presentation of your project

You are expected to turn your slides and code in on XXXXXXX date. You will be presenting your work to your colleagues between YYYYY and ZZZZZZZ dates.
